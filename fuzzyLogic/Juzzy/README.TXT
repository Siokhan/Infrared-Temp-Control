Juzzy is a Java based Fuzzy Logic toolkit developed by Christian Wagner.

It currently supports inference for the following types of FLSs:
- Type-1
- Interval Type-2
- zSlices based General Type-2

The current version of the software is still in beta. Please feel free to use it but be aware that the current code may contain (an very likely will contain!) bugs. I will fix bugs as time goes on but may not be able to fix them straight away. Also, while I would love to provide support for the toolkit, this will not be possible in the general case because of time constraints. If you really are stuck though - let me know.

THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS FREE AS LONG AS YOU CITE ITS USE (see JuzzyLicense.TXT).

Good luck & I hope you find the software useful!

Christian
